empltz-standalone
=================

empltz-standalone is email template web app for mobile phones.  It is only client-side javascript and localStorage, so no server needed.  It is an experience in implementing jQuery Mobile for display ui and Backbone.js for MVC.

Usage
-----
Just clone and open the index.html file in your browser.  Click the plus icon to add template.  Templates can be edited by clicking on the gear icon and deleted using the iOS swipe delete.  Right now it handles email and SMS templates, but iOS doesn't support SMS URIs, so avoid that on your iPhone.
